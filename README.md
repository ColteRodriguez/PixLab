# PixLab: Installation and Troubleshooting
With Dependencies!!

# NOTICES:
It is suuuuuper important to run Setup.py at least once before running the code on a new devide regardless of whether or not the project folder is already configured. See Setup.py most recent commit -- "auto-install packages"

## Also
It is entirely feasible to run the code without the external drive so long as you have a "Project" folder somewhere with the appropriate configuration (see video). Transfering data and running the app across other devices works the same, but would require zipping the "Project" folder and sending it to the device

Sorry for the visual bugs, our worker bees (me) are working so very hard to debug!
Here's a (very unprofessional) code demo video as a placeholder for README -- nobody reads those anyways right?
